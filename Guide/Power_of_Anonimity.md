# The power of anonymity

The art of anonymity doesn't just end with wearing a mask... 
I would give two answers to that; 

1. An anonymous voice has an impact beyond the reach of any possible judgment by our conscience. We cannot categorize an idea that has no owner. The words become true and echo in themselves. 

2. Our name comes from its own definition. Anonymity is necessary for us for protection purposes. Without its protections, we fall, and our whole life with it, perhaps the life of your loved ones too... If you choose the voice of Anonymous, then master the art of anonymity. There is no room for fame on this path..

That being said, aligning with my last NewBloodProject (NBP), this guide had to be written. I will describe, to the best of my own knowledge; , methods, behaviors, habits and tools to adopt in order to maintain this anonymity. 

``Keep in mind : you can only change the world by being free.``

During the process of it, you will have to change password. For this you can use any password generator like this: https://www.dashlane.com/en/features/password-generator

## Behavior 

``Always remember that YOU are your worse enemy's``

As long as you follow common sense like;

- never do anything hacking related outside of your hacking environment

- never do any of your normal computer usage inside your hacking environment

- never mention any information about your real life when talking with other hackers

- never brag about your illegal hacking exploits to friends in real life

If you follow these rules, then you can pretty much do whatever you want with no fear of being in such situations you dont want.
