# The power of anonymity

The art of anonymity doesn't just end with wearing a mask... 
I would give two answers to that; 

1. An anonymous voice has an impact beyond the reach of any possible judgment by our conscience. We cannot categorize an idea that has no owner. The words become true and echo in themselves. 

2. Our name comes from its own definition. Anonymity is necessary for us for protection purposes. Without its protections, we fall, and our whole life with it, perhaps the life of your loved ones too... If you choose the voice of Anonymous, then master the art of anonymity. There is no room for fame on this path..
--------------------------------------------
That being said, aligning with my last NewBloodProject (NBP), this guide had to be written. I will describe, to the best of my own knowledge; , methods, behaviors, habits and tools to adopt in order to maintain this anonymity. 

*Always keep in mind that you can only change the world by being free...*

During the process of it, you will have to change password. For this you can use any password generator like this: https://www.dashlane.com/en/features/password-generator

----------------------------------------------
### Step #1 - Take your phone and check all of the following point
```
Open your settings then go to applications. Delete anything you don't use.
```
```
Now go to privacy (still in your settings). Disables ALL permissions granted concerning:
    - location
    - data collection (including error collection)
    - access to the camera and microphone (except for calls of course)
    - access to contacts
    - access to messages...history of calls..

In short, every authorization that an application doesnt need to work, you disable.
```
```
Make sure to have your screen lock.
```
```
Google account - the more invasive 
open it and do the same as you just did with the phone.
Disable all permissions, read it twice because some settings are well hide. Dont forget turning off:
- history of position (delete also all previous data)
- activities offline (delete also all previous data)
- adds id (delete it / garbage)
- make sure to have two-factor authentification
- change your password with one containing at least 10 characters, mix of letters, numbers, etc.
```
```
Open each one of your social media account (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc), and again, go to your settings and disable the same things as previous.
I think you got it I will not repeat again...
```
```
Open your navigator, go to your settings and delete ALL previous history and cache.
Disable the history, cookies and non necessary authorizations like camera, microphone, location, etc..
```
