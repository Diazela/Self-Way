# OSI - possible attacks by layer

## Layer 1 
The physical layer is vulnerable just to physical attacks. Something like: destroy communication wires, electric interruptions, vandalism, theft, and more.

## Layer 2
The link-layer is up to Wifi (Ethernet) connections. There are a bunch of possible attacks here, network sniffing, ARP poisoning, Wifi Cracking, and MAC spoofing to name a few.

## Layer 3
The network layer is completely focused on IP communications, you can attack this will OS fingerprint (ICMP for recon labors), routing spoofing, and/or ICMP DoS attacks, this produces a complete overload in the network traffic, making the server extremely slow.

## Layer 4
The transport layer is based on end-to-end communications, this one provides certain fiability to the network communications, along with service port management. The possible attacks are service scans and DDoS on TCP-SYN requests.

## Layer 5
The session layer role is starting, preserving, and closing network sessions and communications, along with consistency and integrity. The attacks applied are session-hijacking, DoS, and DNS poisoning.

## Layer 6
The presentation layer responsible is to translate the communications for the application layer (up next), it's up to data transmission, encryption, and compression labors. It can be exploited by force browsing and all related information there, SSL vulnerabilities, and more.

## Layer 7
The application layer it's what the end-user sees, the UI, and the strong presence of software (services and applications), it has a lot of design vulnerabilities and default settings. Can be exploited by malware, worms, phishing, or social engineering-related.
