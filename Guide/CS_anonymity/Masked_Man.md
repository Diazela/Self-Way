Being Anonymous doesn't just end with wearing a mask... Our name comes from its own definition.

</br>

Anonymity is necessary to us for protection purposes. Without this, we fall, and our whole life with it, perhaps the life of your loved ones too... If you choose the voice of Anonymous, then master the art of anonymity. There is no room for fame on this path..

> An anonymous voice has an impact beyond the reach of any possible judgment by our conscience. We cannot categorize an idea that has no owner. Each word become true and echo in themselves.

Following the creation of the NewBloodProject (NBP), this guide had to be written. I will describe, to the best of my own knowledge, as well as the one from others, how to stay safe. **You can only change the world by being FREE.**
   
> OPSEC ?

* * The less you say, the harder it is for people to figure out what you’re doing. You do not want to give people an opportunity to take control of your actions or your life. So, in short; **keep your mouth close**.

## Behavior 
``Always remember that YOU are your worse enemy's``

As long as you follow common sense like;

1. never do anything hacking related outside of your hacking environment
2. never do any of your normal computer usage inside your hacking environment
3. never mention any information about your real life when talking with other hackers
4. never brag about your illegal hacking exploits to friends in real life

If you follow these rules, then you can pretty much do whatever you want with no fear of being in such situations you dont want.

> Privacy is the ability to keep things to yourself by choice, while anonymity means that you want people to see what you do, just not your identity.
   
> Always keep in mind that you dont know who is behind the screen; **wearing the picture of Anonymous does not mean the person is trustable. NEVER.**

> Of course, we are all human behind these masks, and nature being what it is; sometimes relationships slip from anonymity... a lot of the "doxxing" we see is the result. **So boys and girls, think twice.**

## Communication

The most important step is to make sure you can communicate securely without being surveilled. You need a way to communicate privately with your peer group and a way to stay up to date with what's happening around you and where demonstrations are taking place. For that, it's recommended to use two apps: Telegram and Wire. You can find them on either Google's Play Store if you're on Android or Apple's Appstore if you have iOS.

* You should use Telegram groups and channels to stay up to date and alert about what's going on.
* You should use Wire to communicate with your peer group.

### Telegram

Let's start off with the most important points:

* Telegram group chats are not encrypted.
* Telegram channels are not encrypted.
* Normal chats are not encrypted by default
* The secure chat feature is fishy.

Use Telegram to follow channels from your city to stay up to date about what's going down. You can find these channels on social media. Don't write anything there that you wouldn't post on twitter or instagram. If you can read it, so can the police. To keep your phone number private, go to the privacy settings and disallow your phone number from being displayed. 

> Download [Telegram](https://telegram.org/)

### Wire

* End-to-end encrypted : All messaging on Wire uses end-to-end encryption (E2EE), giving users a strong degree of privacy and security.
* Independently audited : Wire is 100% open source with its code available on GitHub, independently audited and ISO, CCPA, GDPR, SOX-compliant.
* Deployment options & device support : Wire can be deployed on Wire's Cloud, your cloud server, or your own on-premises server and all features can be used across web, mobile, and PC. 

> Download [Wire](https://wire.com/en/download/)

### Burner
* A “burner phone” is a cheap, prepaid mobile phone that you can destroy or discard when you no longer need it. You can read more about it here: https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/uk/buying-guides/best-burner-phone
* An APP burning phone number can also be great.

> Here some APP
* [Burners Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adhoclabs.burner)
* [Burners iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id505800761)
* [Hushed Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hushed.release)
* [Hushed iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hushed-free-number-texting/id600520752)
* [CoverMe Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ws.coverme.im)
* [CoverMe iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/coverme-secure-texting-phone/id593652484)
* [Cloud SIM Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cloudsimapp.vtl)
* [Cloud SIM iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/cloud-sim/id1141422197)

### Secure email services 
* Since we’re so deeply entrenched in the Google ecosystem, we use Gmail as our personal email provider. While we love its ease of use, we don’t love that Google keeps all of our private emails on its servers. However, there are secure options like ProtonMail, the same company that brought us ProtonVPN. ProtonMail is based in Switzerland, a nonmember of the surveillance alliance Five Eyes, so the company can’t be forced to give the government customer data (doesn't mean it is 100% safe, nothing is). Rather, all email has end-to-end encryption with open source code, and the service is free for Android, iOS, and web users.

> Download [ProtonMail](https://proton.me/mail/download)

### Temporary email
* Instead of using your private email to register on any services online, use a temporary email. 

> Here some sites
* [Temp-mail](https://temp-mail.org/)
* [Tempmail](https://tempail.com/)
* [Tempmailo](https://tempmailo.com/)
* [Uranomail](https://uranomail.es/)

</p>
   
## Social Media 

**Dont share**
* Image & video: without removing metadata > https://www.verexif.com/en/
* Screenshot of your computer or phone: where we see YOUR actual TIME ZONE

**Dont Enable Auto Login**
* If someone gets access to your phone or computer make sure they can’t automatically access your social sites. Make sure your computer’s browser “remember” your login and password isn’t set.


**Use Two-factor authentication 2FA**
* ‘double checking’ you really are who you say you are by texting your phone a code that you need to enter before you can log in.


**Setup Security Answers**
* You can set up security questions on your accounts use questions that are hard to find out about you.

**Use a VPN**
* Virtual Private Network is an encryption tool. If you want to keep your conversations, messages, and calls secure this is the best solution.


**Keep Antivirus Updated**
* Never go on the internet without installing anti-malware and antivirus software to secure your online activity and important data.


**Change Passwords Frequently**
* Always use a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols to make it harder to break. Good, secure passwords shouldn’t be easy to remember.
* Never use the same password for multiple websites because they will all become compromised.

**Selective Accepting Friends**
* Are they really who they say they are? Do you really know that their profile is real and not fake? The safest option is to only accept“friend” requests from people you know in the real world.


**Turn Off GPS**
* Turn off your GPS to keep your exact location private. If you plan to share images online turn off the GPS function to protect your safety.


**Internet is Permanent**
* Always consider that anything you post stays there forever. Even if you delete your account, someone may already print/copy your content.


**Personal Information**
* Careful who you reveal personal information. Always be suspicious of anyone who asks for your personal information over any social media platform.


**Beware Clicking on Links**
* Even if sent from your friends think twice. Hackers love social platforms because you are more likely to click on something from your friends.


**Block Fake Accounts**
* Sadly social media is full of fake profiles. These can be used for a number of reasons from hacking or monitoring your activities

**Suspicious Login Attempts**
* Social media platforms email you if they feel a login is suspicious. Maybe because it comes from a different IP address, a different browser or your account is sending spamming posts. Keep checking your emails regularly. If you get a suspicious login attempt to your account, change your password as soon as possible.


Keep Browser Updated**
* Make sure you have the latest version of your browser that is not vulnerable to attacks and hackers. Don’t save passwords in your browser because if your system gets compromised your passwords can be easily read.


**Auto Share Options**
* There are options to automatically share posts from one platform to another.


**Close Old Accounts**
* Old social media accounts you haven’t used in years can risk your personal data security. Delete account and remove as much personal information as possible.

**App Authorisation**
* Every time you log in to another site using the option of using a social media login you are granting authorisation to your account. They tell you what data this app will have access to before you agree but if you stop using that site remember to revoke authorisation.


**Password Manager**
* Your passwords are valuable, so treat them that way. There are a number of password manager software available that help you store and organise passwords. This enables you to log in with just one main password that then allows you to access all your accounts. Generate a strong random passwords to make accounts safer.

## Browsing

### What is the meaning of "Anonymity" online ?

> Your information footprint on the Internet is like your body in the physical world: it represents your identity, (like the location of the device you’re posting from or the pattern of your language) may make it possible for someone to uniquely identify you even when there is no name or other explicit identifier attached.

> It is virtually impossible to remain anonymous on the Internet. As a consequence of the protocols used for Internet communication, some details of your device’s setup are communicated to your Internet service provider, and often to the site or service you are using.

> Most web browsers have **private browsing** modes, but this can be misleading; the sites and services you use can still identify you using;

 * IP address

* browser configuration

* browsing history (via cookies)

| And so ... They can still track your activities on those sites.

> Even if you use a tool like an anonymization proxy to cover your 'IP address and the timestamps on your communications', uniquely identifiable information still leaks through;

* browser configuration

* cookies

* the infos you supply by a query-by-example request

> Data mining and inference techniques can be used to match anonymized users to their real identities with a high degree of accuracy, including through;

* language models

* speaker identification

* facial recognition

* location correlation

* activity modeling

* other retrieval techniques

> It doesn’t always require such specialized techniques; `if there is even a single link between an online identity and your real self`, somebody can submit a query using a single identifier to a commercial data-broker service that aggregates data from many sources, and that service will give them a full personal profile, which can include; 

* home address

* income level

* job description

* many other private information

## Proxy

### HTTP Proxy
This is a server that acts as a middle man between two communications, a client and a server. The proxy sets in the middle and can interact with the request/response cycle.

This component is a good thing for privacy, bypassing filters and any kind of censorship, logging and eavesdropping, and another kind of technical restriction, besides traffic capturing and manipulation.

### Three types of proxy

1. **Forward** : proxies are the ones in which the client sends the request to the proxy and fetch the response on behalf, the client can or not know about the proxy but the server doesn't.

This proxy is placed here: `Client -> Proxy -> Internet <= Server`

2. **Reverse** : this is used behind a network architecture and distributes load traffic to the servers. A request goes directly to the proxy and this one handles the request.

Can be seen like this: `Client -> Internet -> Proxy <= Server`

3. **Transparent** : they do not modify any information without any configuration on the request/response cycle. This is commonly used by ISP providers for faster responses.

Here's how is seen: `Client -> Proxy -> Internet => Server`

### MITMProxy overview

This is an interactive console program that allows traffic flow to be intercepted and more.

Run: `mitmproxy` (this will start a console on the 8080 port) **this can be change**.

Then, go to your browser settings and set the manual proxy settings to your localhost IP and set the same port as the `mitmproxy`

When all the setup is done, you can browse and access any website.

## VPS (Virtual Private Server)

</br>

## Cryptocurrency
* Cryptocurrency is an increasingly popular payment method, but contrary to popular belief, it’s not always anonymous. With Bitcoin, for example, all payments are completely transparent. If you want to make anonymous payments, use a cryptocurrency like Monero, which hides the sender, receiver, and amount sent using three different privacy technologies.
