# Think Fast - Act Wise - Stay Free

The art of anonymity doesn't just end with wearing a mask... 
I would give two answers to that; 

1. An anonymous voice has an impact beyond the reach of any possible judgment by our conscience. We cannot categorize an idea that has no owner. The words become true and echo in themselves. 

2. Our name comes from its own definition. Anonymity is necessary for us for protection purposes. Without its protections, we fall, and our whole life with it, perhaps the life of your loved ones too... If you choose the voice of Anonymous, then master the art of anonymity. There is no room for fame on this path..

That being said, aligning with my last NewBloodProject (NBP), this guide had to be written. I will describe, to the best of my own knowledge; , methods, behaviors, habits and tools to adopt in order to maintain this anonymity. 

``Keep in mind : you can only change the world by being free.``

During the process of it, you will have to change password. For this you can use any password generator like this: https://www.dashlane.com/en/features/password-generator

## Behavior 
``Always remember that YOU are your worse enemy's``

As long as you follow common sense like;

1. never do anything hacking related outside of your hacking environment
2. never do any of your normal computer usage inside your hacking environment
3. never mention any information about your real life when talking with other hackers
4. never brag about your illegal hacking exploits to friends in real life

If you follow these rules, then you can pretty much do whatever you want with no fear of being in such situations you dont want.

Always keep in mind that you dont know who is behind the screen; 
- wearing the picture of Anonymous does not mean the person is trustable. NEVER.

Dont share ;
- image & video without removing metadata > https://www.verexif.com/en/
- screenshot of your computer or phone where we see the actual time zone

### Communication

The most important step is to make sure you can communicate securely without being surveilled. You need a way to communicate privately with your peer group and a way to stay up to date with what's happening around you and where demonstrations are taking place. For that, it's recommended to use two apps: Telegram and Wire. You can find them on either Google's Play Store if you're on Android or Apple's Appstore if you have iOS.

• You should use Telegram groups and channels to stay up to date and alert about what's going down in your surroundings.

• You should use Wire to communicate with your peer group.

#### Telegram

Let's start off with the most important points:

• Telegram group chats are not encrypted.

• Telegram channels are not encrypted.

• normal chats are not encrypted by default

• the secure chat feature is fishy.

Use Telegram to follow channels from your city to stay up to date about what's going down. You can find these channels on social media. Don't write anything there that you wouldn't post on twitter or instagram. If you can read it, so can the police. To keep your phone number private, go to the privacy settings and disallow your phone number from being displayed.

#### Wire

• End-to-end encrypted : All messaging on Wire uses end-to-end encryption (E2EE), giving users a strong degree of privacy and security.

• Independently audited : Wire is 100% open source with its code available on GitHub, independently audited and ISO, CCPA, GDPR, SOX-compliant.

• Deployment options & device support : Wire can be deployed on Wire's Cloud, your cloud server, or your own on-premises server and all features can be used across web, mobile, and PC.
